INSTRUCTIONS

WHAT AM I SEEING?

The application consists of 3 different elements:
- The map (left) - 
	* displays the desired data on a map
- The month selector box (top right) -
	* allows the selection of crime in a specific month to be displayed
- The description/selector box (middle right) -
	* if dot map is selected, displays useful information of an individual crime occurrence
	* if heat map is selected, allows the selection of certain crime type to be displayed
- The graph (bottom right) - 
	* shows totals by crime type with current time filter

HOW DO I USE THE APP?

- Toolbar -
	* Select how the data is displayed on the map (plots of individual crimes or a heat map)

- In-Map Filters (when dot map is selected) -
	* Select which types of crimes to be displayed on the dot map

- Selector Box Filters (when heat map is selected) -
	* When heat map is displayed, filtering options become available for the heat map. Select
	  the desired crime type to be displayed on the heat map
